There are N long genomes.
Each genome is split into blocks and only the middle character of each block is given.
So, for each genome, you are given relatively short string which represents some sites of that genome.

Also, there is information, if particular genome contains disease.
The disease is caused by single site mutation.
If g_i = Val then desease is present, and it isn't otherwise (g_i != Val).
Note, that g_i may not belong to short string given to you.

Genomes are generated in a next way.
In the beginning, 10 genomes were generated at random.
For 5 of them g_i = Val and for other 5 g_i != Val.
Next, N - 10 genomes are generated based on 2 previous genomes.
2 random previous genomes are split into 10-30 parts.
Then, part 1 is taken from first genome, part 2 from second, part 3 from first, part 4 from second...

There is also hard version, in which genome is diploid and you are given 2 short strigs for each genome.

The task is to determine block (position in the short string) which contains mutation.

You can output answer as "l r" which means that answer belongs to the [l; r] range.

For each test, there are up to 10 test cases.
1 <= N <= 1000, 1 <= L <= 1000, where L is lenght of short string.
