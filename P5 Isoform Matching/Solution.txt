Time complexity is O(n*q*C), where C indicates an average number of intervals in isoform.

Algorithm simply "combines" each reference isoform with each request isoform (both easy and hard problems).
For "combining" isoforms linear time, 2 iterators teqnique is used.

For speedup reasons, OpenMP is used.
