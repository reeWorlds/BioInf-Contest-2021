There are 2 genomes: major haplotype s0 and minor haplotype s1.
For each test case, your task is to determine if only major haplotype is present in data or there are both genomes.
For some tests, your task is to also determine minor haplotype s1.

Now, more about the given data.
First, you are given reference genotype s0 without any mistakes.
You are also given N genomes of length S.
Each given genome is constructed based on s0 or s1, but each site can be incorrect with probability alpha (sequencing error).
In case there is only one reference haplotype present in the population, all genomes are based on s0.
Otherwise, each genome is based on s1 with probability r and s0 with probability (1 - r).
The difference between s0 and s1 is at least k sites.
