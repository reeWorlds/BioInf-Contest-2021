First, the model given in the original statement is discrete (each person is either infected or not) and median is used.
To make solution much faster, probabilistic model should be used.
Let p_a and p_b are probabilities that persons A and B are infected.
After communication edge (a, b, p) new probability is:
p_b_new =  p_b + (1 - p_b) * p_a * p
At the end of the simulation, we can estimate median as mean.
It is not correct formally, but median and average are somehow correlated, particularly in this problem.

Second, let consider all people that can infect someone else on day 1.
Bruteforce them as superspreaders and take one with the biggest mean.
In some cases, human with the biggest mean does not get max score.
In this case, one with a 2, 3, 4... score should be considered.
Implemented code outputs top10 superspreaders and their score.
